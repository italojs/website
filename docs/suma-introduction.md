![CI Build](https://github.com/herbsjs/suma/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/herbsjs/suma/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/herbsjs/suma)


Suma helps with single value validations.

Extensible, test covered and errors code only!

Suma does not validate schema or objects, just single values. For schema validation take a look at [`herbjs/gotu`](https://github.com/herbsjs/gotu).
